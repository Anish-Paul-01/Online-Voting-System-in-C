![](https://github.com/Anish-Paul-01/Online-Voting-System-in-C/blob/main/Vote.gif)

This program implements a basic **Online voting system in C**, allowing users to manage an election by adding candidate details, allocating unique party numbers, conducting voting, and displaying results. Users can enter candidates' first and last names and party names, after which each candidate is assigned a party number. During the voting process, voters cast their votes by entering the party number of their preferred candidate, with the ability to end voting by entering 0. Finally, the program tallies and displays the total votes each candidate received. This application demonstrates fundamental concepts of user input handling, data storage with structures, and simple voting logic in C.
